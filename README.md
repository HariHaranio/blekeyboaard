**BLE Keyboard with ESP32 and RGB LED**

This project demonstrates how to use the ESP32 as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) keyboard. The ESP32 is connected to five push buttons, each mapped to specific keyboard keys, and an RGB LED that visually indicates the Bluetooth connection status and button presses.

**Features**

Simulates a BLE keyboard using the BleKeyboard library.

Controls an RGB LED to indicate the Bluetooth connection status:

**Red LED:** Blinks when Bluetooth is not connected.

**Green LED:** Lights up briefly upon connection.

**Blue LED:** Lights up when a button is pressed.

Five buttons are mapped to simulate keyboard actions:

**Up Arrow**

**Down Arrow**

**Left Arrow**

**Right Arrow**
